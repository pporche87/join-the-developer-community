I found a 'first-time only' issue on freeCodeCamp. The request was to fix the screen resolution of a specific GIF that showed how to install bootstrap on Codepen.<br>
[Need higher resolution GIF for Codepen #14561](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/14561)<br>
Here is a link to my pull request. freeCodeCamp actually merged my changes!!!<br>

## Publish your Personal Website
After struggling to get a start on design after my left brain wouldn't work, I met with a few learners who helped me to find some free templates and away I went. I'm actually inspired to continue work on the CSS and especially excited to dig up some old project to deploy so everything is working smoothly.

## Find and Join some Meetups and Workshops

I will be attending 2 events this week. The first I've listed will be after retros so I won't have a reflection for that before retros. But the event I attended earlier this week is reflected below.

### Gays Who Tech

Friday April 28. 2017 7:00PM
Jillians<br>
175 Fourth Street<br>
San Francisco, CA

I decided to attend a resume workshop. One of the specs for this week was to work on my personal website, and I considered it good practice to concurrently work on my resume. The workshop was geared towards those making a career change in tech.

### Resume Workshop - Finding a Career in Tech

[Workshop Link](https://www.meetup.com/learn-to-code-san-francisco/events/239316337/)

Tuesday April 25, 2017 6:00PM - 8:00PM<br>
Galvanize San Francisco<br>
44 Tahama Street<br>
San Francisco, CA 94105

There was some great information in the lecture. I was able to make some wonderful progress with my resume, which is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPnJcv8rSVmewYZUxDCPW9mTdVdDrShpt59Fusr_mhA/edit).

My reflection of the event is more based on the feeling of talking to other developers, data scientists, and even the facilitators. There is a warmth and kindness at the guild that is not reflective of my experience of other job seekers and facilitators in the process of either finding or helping others find employment. I've been having a hard time putting it into words, but the vulnerability we seem to share at the guild is invaluable to my learning, and I'm glad I chose to come here.

That said the content of the lecture was fabulous and gave me a springboard to begin crafting my value proposition in the market. I left with a great resume draft, and will enjoy the process of reviewing and upgrading it over the next 9 months. It also serves as a blueprint of the kind of engineer I want to be by the time I leave here. I definitely recommend working on resumes early on in the guild journey. I would also add that although the content was great, I don't think it's a definitive way to go about doing things. I plan on heading to a resume workshop once a month to get more diverse opinions about branching into tech.

Below are my notes:  

Lecture Notes<br>
Why the tech industry?
* High demand
* High pay
* Overlap with several industries
* Increase diversity
* Software engineering
How do you add value?
What relevant strengths do you have?
* Javascript<br>
* Algorithmic thinking (problem-solving)<br>
* Communication skills<br>
* Meta-thinking<br>
* Meta-Analysis<br>
* Ability to work effectively on a team<br>
* Pair Programming<br>
* Ability to work independently to push project to completion<br>
* Production level code<br>
* Git workflow<br>
* Ship code<br>
* Meet specs<br>
* Write modular code<br>

How do your strengths relate to your target role? Connect the dots.<br>
Give examples - be specific  
* Aligns with the ability to write code for the web - This is the primary language and tool I used to learn and write code. I can ship code in this language on-time and in team.
* Allows for better solutions to common problems - I can whiteboard and write psuedocode to better understand a problem before coming up with a solution. This allows for the refactoring process to be more smooth and for me to really understand what I'm writing before I write it.

Required Skills

Strong analytical skills and the ability to pay careful attention to detail are keys to success in software engineering. Also useful is the capacity to work well in groups and a willingness to understand the various roles played by fellow team members. Knowledge about the subject area in which they are working, or the intended audience, is valuable.

* analytical skills
* attention to detail
* work well in groups
* understand roles played by team members

I spent my life in team from the time I was a child, first singing with the choir, then joining the band, traveling the country as an international gold medalist.
